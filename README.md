# 🧠💪 Can Muscular Parameters Predict Symptoms Of Anxiety And Depression? (Research-UNISA)

## 📒 Abstract
> Introduction
- Major depressive disorder and anxiety disorders are among the major public health issues. Therefore, identifying predictors of symptoms of depression and anxiety holds fundamental importance to avoid the aggravation of these conditions. Muscle strength and function (e.g., handgrip strength and timed-stands test) are widely recognized predictors of health outcomes, however, their association with symptoms of depression and anxiety are still not completely understood.

> Objective
- This study investigated the associations between handgrip strength and timed-stands test scores with symptoms of depression and anxiety. In addition, we examined whether individuals exhibiting greater strength levels demonstrate reduced symptoms of anxiety and depression compared to those with lower levels of strength. 

> Methods
- This is a community-based, cross-sectional study. Participants were recruited through social media and underwent a semi-structured interview to record sociodemographic characteristics, comorbidities, use of tobacco and medication, and symptoms of anxiety (Beck’s Anxiety Inventory [BAI]) and depression (Beck’s Depressive Inventory [BDI]). Subsequently, anthropometric characteristics, handgrip strength, and functionality (i.e., timed stands test) were assessed. 

> Results
- Two-hundred and sixteen individuals were evaluated. The adjusted regression model showed an inverse association between handgrip strength and anxiety (β = -0.22; 95%CI -0.38 to -0.07; R2 = 0.07, P = 0.005) and depression symptoms (β = -0.25; 95%CI -0.42 to -0.07; R2 = 0.05, P = 0.006). Similarly, timed-stands test scores were associated with anxiety (β = -0.33; 95%CI -0.54 to -0.13; R2 = 0.09, P = 0.002) and depression (β = -0.32; 95%CI -0.56 to -0.09; R2 = 0.06, P = 0.008). Furthermore, the low strength group showed higher values on the BAI (9.5 vs. 5.9 arbitrary units; P=0.0008) and BDI than the high strength group (10.8 vs. 7.9 arbitrary units; P=0.0214). When individuals were stratified by the timed-stands test, the low timed-stands group demonstrated higher values on the BAI (9.9 vs. 5.5 arbitrary units; P=0.0030) and BDI than the high timed-stands group (11.2 vs. 7.5 arbitrary units; P<0.0001).
